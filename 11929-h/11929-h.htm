<h3>WAGES IN 17TH AND 19TH CENTURIES.</h3>

<p>
Running my eye accidentally through the household book of Sir Roger
Twysden, from 1659 to 1670, it occurred to me to make a comparison
between the relative prices of meat and wages, as there given, in
order to ascertain the position of our peasantry in these parts, at
the close of the 17th century. I send you a few extracts, by which
it will be seen that, in Kent, at least, our agricultural labourers
appear to have been in far better condition than those of the rest
of England, who, in Mr. Macaulay&rsquo;s brilliant work, are represented
as living &ldquo;almost entirely on rye, barley, and oats,&rdquo; owing to the
exorbitantly high price of meat, as compared with the ordinary scale
of wages.
</p>

<p>
As to meat, I find the following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have added, in most instances, the prices now paid to
labourers in these parts, having obtained my information from the
farmers of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>
The price of butchers&rsquo; meat at present, in this neighbourhood, is
from 6<i>d</i>. to 7 1/2<i>d</i>. per lb.; by wholesale, 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. or 3<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per stone.
</p>

<p>
As far, then, as the relative prices of wages and meat can guide us,
the labourer, in these parts, was as well able to purchase meat in
1670 as he is now.
</p>

<p>
Unhappily for him, the imprudence of early marriage entailing upon
him the charge of a family, he is precluded from the indulgence in
fresh meat, except as an occasional treat. Cheese and bacon,
however, are still within his reach. The improvidence of early
marriage rarely occurred in former days, and palpably, if our
Kentish labourers lived <i>entirely</i> on oats and rye, it was not
of <i>necessity</i> that they did so. I am inclined to think that,
in many of the instances given above, especially in haying and
harvest, provisions of some sort were found by the employer, over
and above the wages. When I have more leisure, I will endeavour to
obtain correct information on this point; and meanwhile, send you
the entries just as I find them. I observe an entry of &ldquo;peas to boil
for the men.&rdquo; They had porridge then, at all events, in addition to
their wages; and these wages, if they had so chosen, could further
have purchased them meat, quite as well as at the present day;
though, alas for our poor peasantry, this is not saying much for
them; and even of that little smack of meat they will soon be
debarred, if the present system&mdash;but I am intruding on sacred
ground, and must leave the poor fellows to their hard work and
scanty meals.

<h3>MARLOWE AND THE OLD &ldquo;TAMING OF A SHREW.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
I regret that my communication (No. 13. p. 194.), on the subject of
the authorship of <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i>, was too late to be
of any avail for the already-published new edition of Marlowe&rsquo;s
works; and, had I been aware of such being the case, I should have
waited until I had had an opportunity of seeing a work whose editor
may entertain views in ignorance of which, to my disadvantage, I am
still writing. It is, perhaps, a still greater disadvantage that I
should appear to depend for proofs upon a bare enumeration of
parallel passages; when I know that the space I should require for
the purposes of stating the case fully and fairly, and, as I think,
conclusively, would be utterly inconsistent with that brevity which
must be with you an essential condition; while, at the same time, I
know of no medium through which I am so likely to enlist the
attention of a &ldquo;fit audience&rdquo; as your publication. Premising that my
references are to <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i> in &ldquo;Six Old Plays,&rdquo;
1799, and to Marlowe&rsquo;s Works, edit. 1826, I proceed to indicate such
passages as a rapid glance through the respective works, aided by
some previous acquaintance with the subject, and a not very bad
memory, furnished. Some of the parallels will be found identical; in
others, the metaphors will be found to be the same, with the
expression more or less varied; and in others, again, particular
expressions are the same, though the tenor of the phrase be
different. It will be observed that the quotations of Marlowe are
exclusively from <i>Dr. Faustus</i> and <i>Tamburlaine</i>. Of the
longer passages I have given merely the first line for reference;
and I have numbered them for the convenience of comparison:&mdash;

<p>Leaving the question in this position for the present, I shall be
glad of such information from any of your readers as may tend to
throw a light on the date of Shakspeare&rsquo;s <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>. I find Mr. Collier&rsquo;s opinion expressed in the following
words:&mdash;
</p>

 <blockquote>
 &ldquo;The great probability is that <i>Hamlet</i> was written
  at the earliest in 1601, and the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>
  perhaps came from the pen of its author not very long afterwards.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
I am anxious to ascertain whether I am acquainted with all the
circumstances on which the above opinion is founded; as those which
I can, at this moment, recall, are to my mind hardly sufficiently
conclusive. Rejecting the supposed allusion to Heywood&rsquo;s <i>Woman
Kill&rsquo;d with Kindness</i>, which I see, by a note, Mr. Collier gives
up as untenable ground, the facts, I believe, remain as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
First: <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> was not mentioned by Meres in
1598, whereupon it is assumed that &ldquo;had it been written, he could
scarcely have failed to mention it.&rdquo; And,
</p>

<p>
Second: it must have been written after <i>Hamlet</i>, because the
name Baptista, used incorrectly in that play as a feminine name, is
properly applied to a man in this. And these, I believe, are all.
Now, the first of these assumptions I answer, by asking, &ldquo;Does it
follow?&rdquo; Of all Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays which had then appeared, only
three had been published before 1598, and not one comedy. Meres, in
all probability, had no list to refer to, nor was he making one: he
simply adduced, in evidence of his assertion of Shakspeare&rsquo;s
excellence, both in tragedy and comedy, such plays of both kinds as
he <i>could</i> recollect, or the best of those which he <i>did</i>
recollect. Let us put the case home; not in reference to any modern
dramatist (though Shakspeare in his own day was not the great
exception that he stands with us), but to the world-honoured poet
himself, who has founded a sort of religion in us: I, for my part,
would not be bound not to omit, in a hasty enumeration, and having
no books to refer to, more important works than the <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>. In short, the omission by Meres proves no more than that
he either did not think of the play, or did not think it necessary
to mention it. To the second assumption, I answer that the date of
the <i>first Hamlet</i> is &ldquo;not proven:&rdquo; it may have been an early
play. From the play of <i>Hamlet</i>, in its earlier form, is the
name Baptiste, where it is used in conjunction with Albertus, taken;
the scene mentioned is Guiana; and there is nothing to lead one to
suppose that the name is used as an Italian name at all. Both the
date of <i>Hamlet</i>, therefore, and&mdash;whichever way
decided&mdash;the conclusion drawn from the supposed mistake, I
regard as open questions. There is yet another circumstance which
Mr. Collier thinks may strengthen his conclusion with regard to the
date of this play. He refers to the production of Dekker&rsquo;s
<i>Medicine for a Curst Wife</i>, which he thinks was a revival of
the old <i>Taming of a Shrew</i>, brought out as a rival to
Shakspeare&rsquo;s play. This is easily answered. In the first place,
Katharine, the Shrew, is not a &ldquo;curst wife:&rdquo; she becomes a wife, it
is true, in the course of the play; but this is a part of the
process of taming her. But what seems at once to disprove it is,
that, according to Henslow&rsquo;s account, Dekker was paid 10<i>l</i>.
10<i>s</i>. for the piece in question; as Mr. Collier observes, an
&ldquo;unusually large sum&rdquo; for a new piece, and not likely to be paid for
the bashing up of an old one. I am thus left entirely without a
clue, derivable from external evidence, to the date of this play;
and shall be glad to know if there is any thing, throwing light upon
the point, which I may have overlooked. That more important
consequences are involved in this question than appear upon the face
of it, I think I shall be able to show in a future communication;
and this is my excuse for trespassing so much upon your space and
your readers&rsquo; patience.

<h3>NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES, NO. 6.</h3>

<p>
In a copy of Burnet&rsquo;s <i>Telluris Theoria Sacra</i> (in Latin),
containing only the two first books (1 vol. 4to., Lond. 1689), there
is the following entry in Bishop Jebb&rsquo;s hand-writing:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>
    &ldquo;From the internal evidence, not only of additional matter
    in the margin of this copy, but of frequent erasures and
    substitutions, I was led to suppose it was the author&rsquo;s copy,
    illustrated by his own annotations and improvements. The
    supposition is, perhaps, sufficiently corroborated by the
    following extract from the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>,
    vol. iii. p. 18.
</p>
<p>
   &ldquo;&lsquo;It seems it was usual with Dr. Burnet, before he published
    any thing in Latin, to have two or three copies, and no more,
    printed off, which he kept by him for some time, in order to
    revise at leisure what he had written <i>currente calamo</i>,
    and sometimes, when he thought proper, to be communicated to
    his particular friends for their opinions, &amp;c.&rsquo;
</p>
 <p>
   &ldquo;This copy, as it does not differ from any of the editions of
    1689, was certainly not one of those <i>proofs</i>. But the
    Doctor&rsquo;s habit of annotating on his own Latin books after they
    were printed, renders it extremely probable that this book was
    a preparation for a new edition. It would be well to compare it
    with the English translation.&rdquo;
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The nature of many of the corrections and additions (which are very
numerous), evidently shows a preparation for the press. I have
compared this copy with the English edition, published in the same
year, and find that some of the  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>{228}</span>corrections were adopted; this,
however, but in a few instances, while in one, to be mentioned
presently, a palpable mistake, corrected in the MS. Latin notes,
stands in the translation. The English version differs very
materially from the Latin. The author says in his Preface:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
 &ldquo;This English version is the same in substance with the
  Latin, though I confess, &rsquo;tis not so properly a translation,
  as a new composition upon the same ground, there being
  several additional chapters in it, and several new moulded.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
The following are examples of corrections being adopted: P. 6. Latin
ed. &ldquo;Quod abunde probabitur in principio libri secundi.&rdquo; For the
last word <i>subsequentis</i> is substituted, and the English has
<i>following</i>. P. 35. &ldquo;Hippolitus&rdquo; is added to the authorities in
the MS.; and in the English, p. 36., &ldquo;Anastasius Sinaiti, S.
Gaudentius, Q. Julius Hilarius, Isidorus Hispalensis, and
Cassiodorus,&rdquo; are inserted after Lactantius, in both. P. 37.
&ldquo;Johannes Damascenus&rdquo; is added after St. Augustin in both. P. 180. a
clause is added which seems to have suggested the sentence
beginning, &ldquo;Thus we have discharged our promise,&rdquo; &amp;c. But, on the
other hand, in p. 8. the allusion to the &ldquo;Orphics,&rdquo; which is struck
out in the Latin, is retained in the English; and in the latter
there is no notice taken of &ldquo;Empedocles,&rdquo; which is inserted in the
margin of the Latin. In p. 11. &ldquo;Ratio naturalis&rdquo; is personified, and
governs the verb <i>vidit</i>, which is repeated several times. This
is changed by the corrector into vidimus; but in the English
passage, though varying much from the Latin, the personification is
retained. In p. 58., &ldquo;Dion Cassius&rdquo; is corrected to &ldquo;Xiphilinus;&rdquo;
but the mistake is preserved in the English version.

<h3>SHAKSPEARE&rsquo;S EMPLOYMENT OF MONOSYLLABLES.</h3>

<p> I offer the following flim-flam to the examination of your
readers, all of whom are, I presume, more or less, readers of
Shakspeare, and far better qualified than I am to
&ldquo;anatomize&rdquo; his writings, and &ldquo;see what bred about
his heart.&rdquo; </p>

<p>
I start with the proposition that the language of passion is almost
invariably broken and abrupt, and the deduction that I wish to draw
from this proposition, and the passages that I am about to quote is,
that&mdash;<i>Shakspeare on more than one occasion advisedly used
monosyllables, and monosyllables only, when he wished to express
violent and overwhelming mental emotion</i>, ex. grati&acirc;:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="verse">
   <p><i> Lear.</i> &ldquo;Thou know&rsquo;st the first time that we smell the air,</p>
  <p>We wawl, and cry:&mdash;I will preach to thee; mark me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;[<i>Gloster.</i> &ldquo;Alack! alack the day!]</p>

    <p><i>Lear.</i> &ldquo;When we are born, we cry, that we are come</p>
 <p>
To this great stage of fools,&mdash;This a good block?&rdquo;
</p>

    <p> &mdash;<i>King Lear</i>, Act IV. Sc. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>In this passage [I bracket Gloster] we find no fewer than
<i>forty-two monosyllables</i> following each other consecutively.
Again,</p>

 <div class="verse">
   <p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;
       but through his lips do throng</p>
   <p> Weak words, so thick come, in his poor heart&rsquo;s aid,</p>
   <p>That no man could <i>distinguish</i> what he said.&rdquo;</p>
   <p><i>Rape of Lucreece</i>, Stanza 255.</p>
</div>

<p>
After I had kept this among other flim-flams for more than a year in
my note-book, I submitted it in a letter to the examination of a
friend; his answer was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Your canon is ingenious,
especially in the line taken from the sonnet. I doubt it however,
much, and rather believe that sound is often sympathetically, and as
it were unconsciously, adapted to sense. Moreover, monosyllables are
redundant in our tongue, as you will see in the scene you quote. In
<i>King John</i>, Act III. Sc. 3., where the King is <i>pausing</i>
in his wish to incense Hubert to Arthur&rsquo;s murder, he says:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="verse">
   <p>&lsquo;Good friend, though hast no cause to say so yet:</p>
   <p> But thou shall have; and creep time ne&rsquo;er so slow,</p>
   <p>Yet it shall come, for me to do thee good.</p>
   <p> I had a thing to say,&mdash;But let it go:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>forty monosyllables.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="verse">
   &ldquo;Credimus? an qui amant ipsi sibi somnia fingunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very passage he quoted seemed, to my eyes, rather a
<i>corroboration</i> of the theory, than an <i>argument against
it</i>! I might, I think, have quoted the remainder of Lear&rsquo;s speech
ending with the words &ldquo;Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,&rdquo; and,
with the exception of three words, consisting <i>entirely</i> of
monosyllables, and one or two other passages. But I have written
enough to express my meaning.</p>

<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM&rsquo;S HAND-BOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>

<p><i> Wild House, Drury Lane.</i>&mdash;Mr. Cunningham says,
&ldquo;Why so called, I am not aware.&rdquo; <i>Wild</i> is a
corruption of <i>Weld</i>. It was the town mansion of the family of
the <i>Welds</i>, of Lutworth Castle.</p>

<p><i>Compton Street, Soho.</i>&mdash;Built in the reign of Charles
the First by Sir Francis Compton. <i>New</i> Compton Street, when
first formed, was denominated Stiddolph Street, after Sir Richard
Stiddolph, the owner of the land. It afterwards changed its name,
from a demise of the whole adjoining marsh land, made by Charles the
Second to Sir Francis Compton. All this, and the intermediate
streets, formed part of the site of the Hospital of St. Giles.</p>

<p><i>Tottenham Court Road.</i>&mdash;The old manor-house, sometimes
called in ancient records &ldquo;Totham Hall,&rdquo; was, in Henry
the Third&rsquo;s reign, the residence of William de Tottenhall.
Part of the old buildings were remaining in 1818.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>{229}</span>

<p> <i>Short&rsquo;s Gardens, Drury Lane</i>.&mdash;Dudley Short,
Esq., had a mansion here, with fine garden attached, in the reign of
Charles the Second.</p>

<p><i>Parker Street, Drury Lane.</i>&mdash;Phillip Parker, Esq., had
a mansion on this site in 1623.</p>

<p><i>Bainbridge and Buckridge Streets, St.
Giles&rsquo;s</i>.&mdash;The two streets, now no more, but once
celebrated in the &ldquo;annals of low life,&rdquo; were built prior
to 1672, and derived their names from their owners, eminent
parishioners in the reign of Charles the Second.</p>

<p><i>Dyot Street, St. Giles&rsquo;s.</i>&mdash;This street was
inhabited, as late as 1803, by Philip Dyot, Esq., a descendant of
the gentleman from whom it takes its name. In 1710 there was a
certain &ldquo;Mendicant&rsquo;s Convivial Club&rdquo; held at the
&ldquo;Welch&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; in this street. The origin of this
club dated as far back as 1660, when its meetings were held at the
Three Crowns in the Poultry.</p>

<p><i>Denmark Street, St. Giles&rsquo;s.</i>&mdash;Originally built
in 1689. Zoffany, the celebrated painter, lived at No. 9. in this
street. The same house is also the scene of Bunbury&rsquo;s
caricature, &ldquo;The Sunday Evening Concert:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    &ldquo;July 27. 1771.&mdash;Sir John Murray, late Secretary to the
    Pretender, was on Thursday night carried off by a party
    of strange men, from a house in <i>Denmark Street</i>, near
    St. Giles&rsquo;s church, where he had lived some time.&rdquo;
    &mdash;<i>MS. Diary quoted in Collet&rsquo;s Relics of Literature</i>, p. 306.

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Metrical Charms</i>.&mdash;In the enumeration of the various branches
of that interesting subject, the &ldquo;FOLK LORE OF ENGLAND,&rdquo; on which
communications were invited in the last number of &ldquo;NOTES AND
QUERIES,&rdquo; there is an omission which I beg to point out, as it
refers to a subject which, I believe, deserves especial
investigation, and would amply repay any trouble or attention that
might be bestowed upon it. I allude to <i>Metrical Charms</i>, many
of which are still preserved, and, in spite of the corruptions they
have undergone in the course of centuries, would furnish curious and
valuable illustrations of the Mythological System on which they are
founded.</p>

<blockquote>
    &ldquo;Spirits of the flood and spirits of the hills found a
    place in the mythology of Saxon England,&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>says an able reviewer of Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s <i>Saxons in
England</i>, in <i>The Anthen&aelig;um</i> (13th Jan. 1849); and he
continues,</p>

<blockquote>
   &ldquo;The spells by which they were invoked, and the forms
    by which their aid was compelled, linger, however, still
    amongst us, although their names and powers have passed
    into oblivion. In one of the Saxon spells which
    Mr. Kemble has inserted in the Appendix, we at once
    recognised a rhyme which we had heard an old woman
    in our childhood use,&mdash;and in which many Saxon words
    unintelligible to her were probably retained.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>Who would not gladly recover this &ldquo;old rhyme?&rdquo;&mdash;I can say for
myself, that if these lines should ever meet the eye of the writer
of the passage I have quoted, I trust he will be induced to
communicate, in however fragmentary a shape, this curious addition
to our present scanty stories of mythological information.</p>

<p>While on the subject of <i>Charms and Spells</i>, I would ask
those who are more familiar than myself with the Manuscript treasures
of the British Museum, and of our University Libraries, whether they
have ever met with (except in MSS. of Chaucer) the remarkable
&ldquo;Night Spell&rdquo; which the Father of English Poetry has
preserved in the following passage of his <i>Miller&rsquo;s
Tale</i>. I quote from Mr. Wright&rsquo;s edition, printed for the
Percy Society:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What Nicholas, what how man, loke adoun:</p>
    <p>Awake and think on Cristes passioun</p>
    <p>I crowche the from Elves and from Wightes.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>There with the night-spel seyde he anon rightes</p>
    <p>On the foure halves of the hous aboute</p>
    <p>And on the threissh-fold of the dore withoute.</p>
    <p class="stanza">&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord Jhesu Crist and seynte Benedight,</p>
    <p>Blesse this hous from every wikkede wight</p>
    <p>Fro nightes verray, the white Paternoster</p>
    <p>When wonestow now, seynte Petres soster.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This charm has long occupied my attention, and as I hope shortly
to submit to the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries an attempt to
illustrate some parts of it which are at present certainly involved
in very great obscurity, I shall be glad to be informed whether any
other early version of it is to be found in MS., and if so, where;
and also whether any other version, corrupted or not, is still
preserved, if not in use, at least in memory. I should also be
especially glad of references of any other allusion to the
&ldquo;white Paternoster&rdquo; or &ldquo;seynte Petres
soster,&rdquo; or for any information as to sources for ascertaining
the history, whether authentic or legendary, of the personage
supposed to be alluded to in the closing words of this remarkable
spell.</p>

<p><i>Pope&rsquo;s Translations of Horace.</i>&mdash;In a pamphlet
against Pope, entitled, <i>A True Character of Mr. Pope and his
Writings</i>, by the author of <i>The Critical History of
England</i>, written in May, 1716, and printed in that year, Pope is
reproached with having just published a &ldquo;libellous,&rdquo;
&ldquo;impudent,&rdquo; and &ldquo;execrable&rdquo; <i>Imitation of
Horace</i>. Twenty years later such a reproach would be very
intelligible; but can any one favour me with a reference to any
<i>Imitation of Horace</i>, published by Pope prior to 1716, of
which any such complaint could be made?</p>

<p><i>Arabic Numerals</i>.&mdash;In the <i>Arch&aelig;ological
Journal</i> (vol. vi. p. 291.), it is stated that the earliest
&ldquo;example of the use of Arabic numerals in any work connected
with building&rdquo; is the date 1445, on the tower of Heathfield
Church, Sussex, though &ldquo;they were common in MSS. after 1320,
and in astronomical Tracts as early as 1290.&rdquo; As it is
probable that not a few instances of the employment of the Arabic
numeral characters of an earlier date than that at Heathfield are to
be met with in different parts of the country, will you permit me to
make use of your paper to inquire whether any such are known to any
of your readers, and if they will be so obliging as to communicate
their knowledge through the medium of your columns? As the subject
is one of considerable interest, it would be desirable that

sixteenth century should be made known, and registered in your
valuable publication.</p>

<p>Permit me also to ask, in connection with this subject, for
references to any works or treatises supplying information on the
history of the Arabic numerals, their origin, and their introduction
into Europe. I am already acquainted with Astle, <i>On Writing</i>,

wish for additional, and, if possible, more recent information.</p>

<p>Does any one of your readers know what became of the MSS.
formerly in the possession of the above-named Thomas Astle, formerly
Keeper of the Tower Records? In Sir W. Burrell&rsquo;s Sussex

<p><i>Seal of Killigrew, and Genealogy of the Killigrew

informed that the arms on the seal at Sudbury are certainly those of
a member of the old Cornish house of Killigrew. These arms, impaled
by those of Lower, occur on a monument at Llandulph, near Saltash,
to the memory of Sir Nicholas Lower, and Elizabeth his wife, who
died in 1638. She was a daughter of Sir Henry Killegrewe, of London,
and a near relative, I believe, of the Master of the Revels.</p>

<p>While on this subject, I beg to put a query to your genealogical
readers. The double-headed eagle, the bordure bizant&eacute;e, and the
demilion charged with bezants, are all evident derivations from the
armorial bearings of Richard, titular king of the Romans, Earl of
Cornwall, &amp;c., second son of King John. The family of Killegrewe is
of venerable antiquity in Cornwall. What I wish to ascertain is, the
nature of the connection between the family and that unfortunate
&ldquo;king.&rdquo; Was it one of consanguinity, or merely one of feudal
dependence?</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>SELAGO AND SAMOLUS.</h3>

<p>In common with the mistletoe and vervain the Druids held the Selago
and Samolus as sacred plants, and never approached them but in the
most devout and reverential manner. When they were gathered for
religious purposes the greatest care was taken lest they should fall
to the earth, for it was an established principle of Druidism, that
every thing that was sacred would be profaned if allowed to touch
the ground; hence their solicitude to catch the anguinum:</p>


<div class="poem">
<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
                            When they bear</p>
    <p>  Their wond&rsquo;rous egg aloof in air:</p>
    <p>  Thence before to earth it fall,</p>
    <p>  The Druid in his hallow&rsquo;d pall</p>
    <p>  Receives the prize.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Pliny, in his <i>Natural History</i> (lib. xxiv. cap. 11.)
gives a circumstantial account of the ceremonies
used by the Druids in gathering the Selago and
Samolus, and of the uses to which they were applied:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Similis berb&aelig; huie sabin&aelig; est Selago appellata.
    Legitur
    sine ferro dextra manu per tunicam, qua sinistra
    exuitur velut a furante, candida veste vestito, pureque
    lotis nudis pedibus, saero facto priusquam legatur,
    pane vinoque. Fertur in mappa nova. Hanc contra omnem
    perniciem habendam prodidere Druid&aelig; Gallorum, et contra
    omnia oculorum vitia fumum ejus prodesse.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Iidem Samolum herbam nominavere nascentem in humidis:
    et hanc sinistra manu legi a jejunis contra morbos suum
    boumque, nec respicere legentem: nec alibi quam in
    canali, deponere, ibique conterere poturis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the very slight manner in which these plants are described by
Pliny, it is next to impossible to identify them with any degree of
certainty, though many attempts for the purpose have been made. So
far as I know, Pliny is the only ancient author who mentions them,
and we have therefore nothing to guide us beyond what he has said in
this passage.</p>

<p>The word Selago is supposed to be derived from <i>se</i> and
<i>lego</i>, i.e. <i>quid certo ritu seligeretur</i>. Linn&aelig;us
appropriated the name to a pretty genus of Cape plants, but which
can have nothing whatever to do with the Selago of the Druids. It
has been thought to be the same as the Serratula Cham&aelig;peuce of
Linn&aelig;us, but without sufficient reason, for Pliny says it resembles
the savine; and Matthiolus, in his <i>Commentary on Dioscorides</i>,
when speaking of the savine (Juniperus Sabina), says:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
    &ldquo;Siquidem vidi pro Sabina assumi quandam herbam
    dodrantalem qu&aelig; quibusdam in montibus plurima nascitur,
    folio tamaricis, licet nec odore nec sapore Sabinam
    Hanc s&aelig;pius existimavi esse Selaginem referat.  a Plinio
    lib. xxiv. c. 11. commemoratam.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Samolus, or as some copies read Samosum, is said to be derived from
two Celtic words, <i>san</i>, salutary, and <i>mos</i>, pig;
denoting a property in the plant which answers to the description of
Pliny, who says the Gauls considered the Samolus as a specific in
all maladies of swine and cattle.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>{232}</span>
But there is not less
difficulty in identifying this plant than in the former case. Some
have thought it the same as the little marsh plant, with small white
flowers, which Linn&aelig;us calls Samolus Valerandi, while others
consider it to be the Anemone Pulsatilla. I am ignorant of the
salutary properties of these plants, and must leave it to be decided
which of them has the greatest claims to be considered the Samolus
of Pliny.</p>

<i>Selago and Samolus</i>.&mdash;The Selago (mentioned by &ldquo;PWCCA,&rdquo; No.

to the Samolus, which was called <i>Gwlydd</i>, mild or tender. All

<h3>&AElig;LFRIC&rsquo;S COLLOQUY.</h3>

<p>In the Anglo-Saxon <i>Gloss</i>, to &AElig;lfric&rsquo;s Latin
dialogue, <i>higdifatu</i> is not, I conceive, an error of the
scribe, but a variation of dialect, and therefore, standing in no
need of correction into <i>hydigfatu</i> (&ldquo;NOTES and
QUERIES,&rdquo; No. 13.). <i>Hig, hi</i> and <i>hy</i>, are
perfectly identical, and nothing is more usual in A.S. than the
omission of the final <i>g</i> after <i>i</i>; consequently,
<i>hig<big><b>=</b></big>hy, di<big><b>=</b></big>dig</i>, therefore <i>higdi<big><b>=</b></big>hydig</i>. Mr.
Singer&rsquo;s reading of <i>cassidilia</i> for <i>culidilia</i>, I
consider to be well-founded.</p>

<p>His conjecture, that <i>sprote</i>=Goth. <i>sprauto</i>, has
something very specious about it, and yet I must reject it. That
useful and sagacious author, Dr. Kitchener, tells us, that there is
only one thing to be done in a hurry (or <i>sprauto</i>); and even
if he had not informed us what that one thing is, very few indeed
would ever have imagined that it was <i>fish</i>-catching. The word
<i>sprote</i> was a puzzle to me, and I had often questioned myself
as to its meaning, but never could get a satisfactory answer; nor
was it until some time after the publication of the 2nd edition of
my <i>Analecta</i> that it occurred to me that it might signify a
wicker or <i>sallow</i> basket (such as is still in use for the
capture of eels), from Lat. <i>sporta</i>, whence the German
<i>sportel</i>. My conjecture, of <i>salice</i> for the <i>salu</i>
of the text, was based on the possibility that the apparatus might
somehow or other be made of the <i>salix</i>.</p>

<p>I beg leave to inform &ldquo;SELEUCUS,&rdquo; that <i>The
Ph&oelig;nix</i>, with an English version, and with the Latin
original, is to be found in the <i>Codex Exoniensis</i>, edited by
me, in 1842, for the Society of Antiquaries. The Latin ascribed to
Lactantius, is printed in the Variourum edition of Claudian, and, I
believe, in the editions of Lactantius.</p>

<h3>PORTRAITS OF LUTHER AND ERASMUS.</h3>

<p>Your correspondent, &ldquo;R.G.&rdquo; (No. 13. p. 203.), is
correct in supposing the <i>wood-cut</i> portrait of Luther to be
that which is prefixed to the treatise &ldquo;De Captivitate
Babylonica Ecclesi&aelig;,&rdquo; where he is habited as a monk; but
it was evidently only a copy from the very interesting copper-plate
engraving of his friend Lucas Cranach, bearing the date 1520, of
which a very accurate copy was prefixed to the translation of
&ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s Way to Prayer,&rdquo; published by Mr.
Pickering in 1846. Juncker&rsquo;s book is a very good repertory of
the various representations of the great reformer, but the prints
are generally but faithless copies. In 1750 Kirchmayer printed an
especial disquisition upon the portrait by Lucas Cranach of 1523,
under the following title:&mdash;&rdquo;Disquisitio Historia de
Martini Lutheri Oris et Vultus Habitu Hervieo ad vivum expresso in
Imagine divine pencilli Luc&aelig; Cranachj patris in &aelig;re hic
incisa,&rdquo; &amp;c., Witteberg&aelig; Sax. 1750, 4to. The works
in which the Germans have sought to do honour to their great
protestant saint, are numerous enough to fill a small library but
two of them are so remarkable as to deserve notice, 1.
&ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s Merkw&uuml;rdige Lebensumstande bey seiner
Medicinalischen Leibesconstitution, Krankheiten, geistlichen und
leiblichen Anfectungen und andern Zufallen, &amp;c., von F.G.
Keil,&rdquo; Leipsig, 1764. 2. &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s
Merkw&uuml;rdige Reisegeschichte zu Erganzung seiner Lebensumstande,
von Jo. Th. Lingke,&rdquo; Leipsig, 1769, 4to. The earliest wood-cut
representation of Erasmus with which I am acquainted is a medallion
accompanying another of Ulric of Hutten, on the title-page of the
following work of the unfortunate but heroic champion of the
Reformation:&mdash;&rdquo;Ulrichi ab Hutten cum Erasmo Rotirodamo,
Presbytero, Theologo, Expostulatio.&rdquo; There is reason to
believe that this Expostulation was printed only a short month
before Hutten died; and, though it bears neither date nor name of
printer, that it was printed by Johannes Schott, at Strasburg, in
the month of July, 1523. It has another portrait of Hutten at the
end, the whole strikingly spirited and characteristic; by some they
have been attributed to Holbein, and if not by him, which is
doubtful, they are at least worthy of him.</p>

<p>One would gladly forget this strife between the great promoter of
learning and the soldier-scholar. Erasmus&rsquo;s conduct was
unworthy of a great man, and can never be vindicated.</p>

<p>By a note of mine, I find that this secular priest, W. Watson, lays
the expression in question to the charge of the Jesuits as &ldquo;an
heretical and most dangerous assertion of theirs.&rdquo; Admitting,
therefore, the <i>Discurs. Modest</i>. to have been published after
Watson&rsquo;s <i>Decacordon</i>, i.e. later than 1602 (which can hardly
be doubted), still the further question remains to be asked: &ldquo;In
what writings of the Jesuits, prior to 1602, had W. Watson himself
found these words, with which he charges them?&rdquo; Should you think
this further query of importance enough to find a place in your

<i>Meaning of &ldquo;Pallace</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;The term &ldquo;Pallace&rdquo; (No. 13. p. 202.)
is applied in Totnes to denote a landing-place inclosed by walls,
but not roofed in. Many of these &ldquo;pallaces&rdquo; have been converted into
coal-cellars. Perhaps <i>pales</i> may have been used originally to
form these inclosures in lieu of walls;&mdash;and hence the word
&ldquo;pallace&rdquo; would mean a place paled in. I find repeated mention made
of &ldquo;pallaces&rdquo; in a schedule attached to a deed of the Corporation of
Totnes, bearing date September 18th, 1719, a copy of which is now
before me, and from it the following extracts are taken:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   &ldquo;One linney and two <i>pallaces</i> or yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>   &ldquo;All those houses, rooms, cellars, and <i>pallaces</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>   &ldquo;All that great cellar lately rebuilt, and <i>the plott of ground
    or pallace</i> thereto belonging lately converted into a cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>   &ldquo;All that little cellar and <i>pallace</i> lately rebuilt, and
    the kay or landing place thereto belonging, and near adjoyning

(No. 13. p. 203.), may thus be settled. The first edition of this
Bible, printed in 1568, contains a new translation of the Psalms by
Becon. In the second folio edition, 1572, are inserted, in opposite
columns, &ldquo;the translation according to the Ebrewe,&rdquo;
which differs but little from the former, in Roman letter, and
&ldquo;the translation used in common prayer,&rdquo; or that of the
Great Bible, printed by Whitchurch, 1553, in black letter.</p>

<p>The clarum et venerabile nomen associated with the Bishops&rsquo;
Bible, a very magnificent and perfect copy of which is now open
before me, suggests the inquiry whether there is any copy known of
Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s rare volume on the English Church, 1572,
which is not noticed by Martin in the list of eighteen which he had
discovered. He does not mention that in the Chetham library.</p>

<p><i>Pandoxare</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent, &ldquo;H.B.&rdquo;
(No. 13. p. 202.), has lighted upon a curious specimen of domestic
hieroglyphics, the notice of which recalls to mind the quaint
marginal symbols scattered over the inventories of the Exchequer
Treasury, at a much earlier period. They are not devoid of
information or interest. The word of which he requests explanation,
is, indeed, of too base Latinity to be found in the
<i>Facciolati</i>, or even in the <i>Auctarium</i>; but in our old
Latin dictionaries, sources of abundant information on obsolete
expressions, the word is readily to be found. Old Gouldman, for
instance, whose columns are replete with uncommon and local English
terms, gives &ldquo;<i>Pandoxor</i>, to brew,&rdquo; citing Alciatus
as authority, and &ldquo;<i>Pandox</i>, a swill-bowl,&rdquo;
apparently a word used by Statius. It is obviously a barbarous
derivative of the same Greek words as <i>Pandocium</i> or
<i>Pandoxarium</i> (<i title="pan">&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</i> and <i title="docheion">&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</i>), the
hostelry open to all comers. If, however, a more recondite authority
for the explanation of the word, as formerly used in England, be
desired, I would refer your querist to the pages of the
<i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, where may be
found&mdash;&ldquo;Bruwyn ale or other drynke, <i>Pandoxor</i>.
Browstar, or brewere, <i>Pandoxator, Pandoxatrix</i>,&rdquo; the
medieval Bass or Guinness having been, most frequently, a female.
And, having cited the primitive lexicographer of Norfolk, I would
seize the occasion to offer a note, in response to the numerous
queries regarding the too tardy advance of the work in question, and
to assure your readers, who may be interested in the publications of
the Camden Society, that a further instalment of the

<i>Saint Thomas of Lancaster</i>.&mdash;Not having Brady at hand, I
cannot tell what authorities he cites; but, as Mr. Milnes (No. 12.
p. 181.) does not mention Rymer, he perhaps may not know that he
will find in that collection some documentary evidence on the
subject of this saint, if saint he was; for instance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>   &ldquo;<i>Super rumore Thomam nuper Comitem Lancastri&aelig; miraculis
    corruscuri</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Rym. F&oelig;d. iii. p. 1033. A.D. 1323.
   &ldquo;Quod,&rdquo; adds the king, &ldquo;moleste gerimus.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>But Edward III. was of quite another mind, and urged his
canonization of the Holy See. Witness Rymer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>   &ldquo;<i>Ad Papam; pro canonisatione Thomaelig; nuper Comitis
    Lancastri&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;F&oelig;d. iv. p. 2. A.D. 1326.</blockquote>
<p>And again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>   &ldquo;<i>Pro custodi</i>&ldquo; (Weryngton mentioned by Mr. Milnes),
   &ldquo;<i>Capell&aelig; ad montem ubi nuper comes Lancastri&aelig; decollatus
    fuit</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Ib. p. 291.</blockquote>
<p>It seems that the bodies of some of Thomas&rsquo;s accomplices were also
supposed to have worked miracles; for we find an ordinance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>   &ldquo;<i>Contra Fingentes miracula fieri per inimicos Regis</i>.&rdquo;
    &mdash;Rym. F&oelig;d. iv. p. 20. A.D. 1323.</blockquote>
<p>Andrews says (<i>Hist</i>. i. 342.) that Richard II. renewed the
application for Thomas&rsquo;s canonization; but he does not give his
authority, and I have not time to look further through Rymer.</p>
<p>p. 184. <i>Jhon-John</i>.&mdash;I wonder Mr. Williams does not see that the
<i>h</i> is not &ldquo;<i>introduced</i>&ldquo; for any purpose; it is an

no slang phrase of the eighteenth century; it is a proverbial
expression as old as the days of the romances of <i>Roland</i> and
<i>Olivier</i>. The other two were phrases put into the mouths of
two characters (Dr. Ollapod, in Colman&rsquo;s <i>Poor Gentleman</i>, and
Young Rapid, in Morton&rsquo;s <i>Cure for the Heart-ache</i>), which grew
into vogue only from the success of the actors Fawcett and Lewis,
and had no meaning or allusion beyond what the words obviously
meant.</p>

<i>Lay of the Ph&oelig;nix.</i>&mdash;&rdquo;SELEUCUS&rdquo; (No. 13, p. 203.) asks, &ldquo;Is
there any published edition of the hexameter poem by Lactantius,
which is said to have suggested the idea of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Lay
of the Ph&oelig;nix</i>?&rdquo; This poem is not in hexameter, but in elegiac
verse; and though, on account of its brevity, we could not expect
that it would have been separately published, it is to be found very
commonly at the end of the works of Lactantius; for example, in
three editions before me, Basil. 1524, Lugd. 1548, Basil. 1563. That
this poem, however, belongs to the Christian Cicero, at any period
of his life, is more than doubtful, even by the admission of
Romanists, who readily avail themselves of other compositions of
similar authority. It has been sometimes ascribed to Venantius
Fortunatus, and is by Sirmondus attributed to Theodulphus, Bishop of
Orleans. (<i>Opp.</i>, ii. 840. cf. iv. 519. Venet. 1728.)</p>

by &ldquo;K.M.P.&rdquo; (No. 13, p. 203.), with regard to the double second
lessons for the Feast of St. Michael and All-Angels, is easily
resolved by comparing the Table of Proper Lessons before and after
the last review of the <i>Prayer Book</i> in 1662; from which it
will be seen, that the proper <i>second</i> lessons were then
appointed for the first time, while the old second lessons for Sept.
29. were retained, either from inadvertence, or to avoid the
necessity of disarranging all the subsequent part of the calendar.
The present first lessons, Gen. xxxii., and Dan. x. v. 5., at the
same time took the place of the inappropriate chapters, Eccles.
xxxix. and xliv., which had been appointed for this day in Queen

<i>Meaning of &ldquo;Pisan.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Mr. Turner (No. 7. p.100.) asks the
meaning of the term <i>pisan</i>, used in old records for some part
of defensive armour.</p>
<p>Meyrick (<i>Ancient Armour</i>, vol. i. p. 155, 2d ed.) gives a
curious and interesting inventory of the arms and armour of Louis le
Hutin, King of France, taken in the year 1316, in which we find,
&ldquo;Item 3 coloretes <i>Pizanes</i> de jazeran d&rsquo;acier.&rdquo; He describes
<i>pizane</i> (otherwise written <i>pizaine, pusen, pesen</i>) as a
collar made, or much in fashion, at Pisa. The jazeran armour was
formed of overlapping plates. In the metrical romance of <i>Kyng
Alisaunder</i>, edited by Webber, occur the lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p>   &ldquo;And Indiens, and Emaniens,</p>
<p>    With swordes, lances, and <i>pesens.</i>&ldquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Weber explains the <i>pesens</i> here as gorgets, armour for the
neck.</p>
<p>In more recent MSS. <i>pisan</i> may be a contraction for
<i>partisan</i>, a halberd.</p>
<p>I cannot agree with your correspondent &ldquo;A.F.&rdquo; (p.90), that the nine
of diamonds was called &ldquo;the curse (cross) of Scotland&rdquo; from its
resemblance to the cross of St. Andrew, which has the form of the
Roman X; whereas the pips on the nine of diamonds are arranged in
the form of the letter H. &ldquo;Mend the instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Pokership&mdash;God tempers the Wind</i>.&mdash;I am disposed to think that
<i>Parkership</i> will turn out to be the right explanation, because
almost every forest or chase contained a <i>fenced park</i>, in
which the deer were confined; and the charge of the woods and park
might be consigned to the same person; and the error in spelling the
word was probably copied from one genealogist to another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Corney&rsquo;s conjecture may be right, as Forby
(<i>Vocabulary,</i> vol. ii. p. 258.) mentions Poke-Day as the day
on which the allowance of corn is made to the labourers, <i>who, in
some places, receive a part of their wages in that form.</i> Now the
<i>Pokerer</i> might be the officer who distributed the grain on
these occasions.</p>

<p><i>Madoc&rsquo;s Emigration to
America.</i>&mdash;&rdquo;ANGLO-CAMBRIAN&rdquo; (No. 4. p. 57.), in
contradiction to the occurrence of Madoc&rsquo;s emigration, has
adduced what he supposes to be a gross anachronism in the words
&ldquo;Madoc was directed by the <i>best compass</i>, and this in
1170!&rdquo; Now, unfortunately for this opinion, the passage on
which it is founded will not allow of his interpretation. The
original words are in Sir Thomas Herbert&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>,
and, in his expressive language, they are as
follows:&mdash;&rdquo;By Providence, the best compass, and benefit
of the pole-star, he returned safely to his own country.&rdquo; Most
certainly this cannot imply that Madoc was acquainted with the
mariner&rsquo;s compass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;J.M.T.&rdquo; also seems to give great weight to the fact of a
&ldquo;Welsh-Indian vocabulary&rdquo; having been formed, containing no trace of any Celtic root. This seems conclusive, yet it is not so; for I have some words, extracted from a vocabulary of the Mandan (Indian)
language made by Mr. Catlin, during his sojourn among them, all of
which, with very slight allowance for corruption, are clearly Welsh.
Mr. Catlin believes the Mandans to have been descended from the
followers of Prince Madoc, from the strong evidence which he
considers his stay among them afforded him, and detailed in his work
on the Indians. I regret to add, that the Mandans have been
exterminated by the small-pox and the weapons of their enemies. I
have long taken a deep, because a national, interest in this
question, and have endeavoured to examine in the spirit of that
noble <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>{237}</span>precept, which ought to be bound up with the existence of
every <i>Cymro</i>, &ldquo;The truth against the world.&rdquo; Consequently, I
have found that much of what is put forth as evidence on this
question is, as Mr. Corney has very justly intimated, quite
inadmissible; in short, unworthy of belief. Still, the inquiry has
afforded me sufficient reasons for viewing the question of Prince
Madoc&rsquo;s emigration as a fact, and for supporting it as such as far
as my humble testimony will allow.</p>

<p><i>Miry-land Town.</i>&mdash;As an addition to the note of
&ldquo;J.R.F.&rdquo; (p. 167. No. 11.) on Miry-land Town, and by way
of corroboration of his reading, I may just mention that the towns
and villages in the Weald of Kent are familiarly spoken of as places
&ldquo;down in the mud,&rdquo; by the inhabitants of other parts of
the country. Those who are acquainted with the Weald will agree that
this designation is not undeserved.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

<p>The Surtees Society, for the publication of inedited MSS.
illustrative of the intellectual, moral, religious, and social
condition of those parts of the United Kingdom which constitute the
ancient kingdom of Northumberland, has been remodelled. The
subscription for the year is one guinea, and the works in immediate
preparation are, 1. &ldquo;The Injunctions and other Ecclesiastical
Proceedings of Richard Barnes, Bishop of Durham (1577-87);&rdquo;
and, 2. &ldquo;The Anglo-Saxon Hymnarium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have great pleasure in directing attention to the <i>Exhibition
of Works of Ancient and Medi&aelig;val Art</i> which is to be opened in
the Adelphi next month.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity for forming an Exhibition of a novel and
most interesting kind, one which is calculated both to interest and
amuse the arch&aelig;ologist and the public, and to instruct the artizan
and the manufacturer. We sincerely hope possessors of articles
suitable for exhibition, will not fail to take advantage of it. They
should immediately enter into communication with the Honorary
Secretary to the Exhibition, at the rooms of the Society of Arts, or
they will be too late.</p>

<p>The <i>Gentlemen&rsquo;s Magazine</i> realizes all our
anticipations. The Reviews are of a very superior order. Justice is
done <i>to</i> as well as <i>upon</i> the authors who have come
under notice, and the original articles are of high value; those
upon the <i>Dea Sequana</i> and the <i>History of Words</i> are
especially worthy of notice. Mr. Waller&rsquo;s papers upon
<i>Christian Iconography</i> promise to be of the highest value. A
new career of usefulness and honour has been opened up to Sylvanus
Urban, who seems determined to merit the addition lately made to his
title, and to become what is really a desideratum in English
Literature&mdash;a good &ldquo;<i>Historical Review</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell, on Thursday and Friday next, a
very choice Selection of Magnificent Books and Pictorial Works from
the Library of an eminent Collector, including large paper copies of
the Antiquarian Works of Visconti, Montfaucon, &amp;c.; the first four
editions of Shakspeare, and other works of similar high character.</p>

<p>We have received the following Catalogues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
   &ldquo;Catalogue of most splendid and truly valuable Ancient
   Manuscripts upon Vellum and Paper, particularly rich in History
   and Topography, Heraldry and County Visitations, Pedigrees and
   Family History, Ancient Charters, Royal Grants and other Documents
   of peculiar interest to the Antiquary and Historian, on sale by
   Thomas Thorpe, 13. Henrietta Street, Covent Garden; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   &ldquo;Bernard Quartch&rsquo;s Catalogue of Foreign and English
   Books, selling for Cash at very reduced Prices, at 16. Castle

<p>The above COMMITTEE has been formed for the purpose of organising an
EXHIBITION OF WORKS OF ANCIENT AND MEDI&AElig;VAL ART. The SOCIETY OF ARTS
having considered that such an Exhibition is not only likely to be
interesting to the public, but also to be especially useful to
Manufacturers (with reference to the Exhibition of Works of Industry
of all Nations to be held in the year 1851), have placed a portion
of their Rooms at the disposal of the Committee, and have agreed to
adopt the Exhibition as part of that annually made by the Society,
thereby taking all the expenses connected with it upon themselves.
The Committee, regarding the Exhibition in the twofold character
contemplated by the Society of Arts, have resolved that the objects
of ancient and medi&aelig;val art of which the Exhibition is to be
composed, shall, as far as possible, be selected with reference to
their beauty and the practical illustration which they are likely to
afford of processes of manufacture; and now beg to invite the
possessors of Works deemed suitable for such an exhibition to assist
the Committee in their very important office, by entering into
communication with them, respecting the nature of any objects which
they may be willing to offer for exhibition.</p>
<p>It is requested that all Works proposed for exhibition be punctually
sent to the Rooms of the SOCIETY OF ARTS, John Street, Adelphi, on
or before the 20th of February, it being imperative that the
Exhibition should open in early March.</p>
<p>Letters and Communications should be addressed to AUGUSTUS W.
FRANKS, Esq. Honorary Secretary to the Committee, Society of Arts,
John Street, Adelphi.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
